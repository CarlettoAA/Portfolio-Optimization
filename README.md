# Portfolio-Optimization
## Linear programming models based on Omega ratio for the Enhanced Index Tracking Problem.

The project is the core of my final exam at Politecnico di Torino, Bachelor degree in Mathematics for Engineering.

I developed the content of the following article: "Linear programming models based on Omega ratio for the Enhanced Index Tracking Problem" by G. Guastaroba, R. Mansini, W. Ogryczak, M. G. Speranza.

Datasets I used are the same indicated in the article.

I used **Guroby Optimizer Software** for a better performance of my code.

The portfolio is calculated using a look-back approach.
