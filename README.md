# Portfolio-Optimization
## Linear programming models based on Omega ratio for the Enhanced Index Tracking Problem.

:smile: The project is the core of my final exam at Politecnico di Torino, Bachelor degree in Mathematics for Engineering.

I developed the content of the following article: "Linear programming models based on Omega ratio for the Enhanced Index Tracking Problem" by G. Guastaroba, R. Mansini, W. Ogryczak, M. G. Speranza.

Datasets I used are the same indicated in the article.

I used **Guroby Optimizer Software** for a better performance of my code.

The portfolio is calculated using a look-back approach.

EORRF_model is the file with the Enahnced Problem where the aim is to outperform the benchmark by a value alpha, instead ORRF_model is just for tracking the benchmark. In both cases the benchmark is the mean of all the assets present in the dataset.

There are a lot of parameters and results obviusly depends on those. :fire:
